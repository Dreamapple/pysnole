.. PyQTermWidget documentation master file, created by

   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to PyQTermWidget's documentation!
=========================================

Unlike the older pyqonsole this console widget works with PyQt4 and let's you
embed a shell into your application. 

For the vt100 terminal emulation I adapted code from AjaxTerm.
