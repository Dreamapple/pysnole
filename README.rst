PyQTermWidget
=============

Unlike the older pyqonsole this console widget works with PyQt4 and let's you
embed a shell into your application. 

See *docs/usage.rst* if you want to know how to use this widget. To test
the widget you can execute *demo.py*.

Or browse the generated HTML documentation at
http://packages.python.org/pyqterm/

For the vt100 terminal emulation I adapted code from AjaxTerm.
